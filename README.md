## Rasa Starter Pack: Telecom in English

Rasa has created a new starter pack for building AI assistants in Telecom with the Rasa CALM framework.

Our Telecom Intelligent Assistant can
- Troubleshoot internet issue
- Teach the user how to reset their router
- Check the user balance
- Understand the user billing

You can use this demo assistant as a starting point for your own Telecom Intelligent Assistant, or get ideas for features you might want to implement. It's free for you to copy and use locally with the Rasa Pro Developer Edition.
