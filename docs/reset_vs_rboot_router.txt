Rebooting a router means simply turning it off and back on without changing any settings. This helps resolve temporary issues like slow speeds or dropped connections and is done by pressing the power button or unplugging the device for a few seconds before turning it back on. Resetting a router, on the other hand, restores it to factory settings, erasing all custom configurations such as the Wi-Fi name, password, and advanced settings. This is done by holding the reset button for about 10-30 seconds until the router restarts. While rebooting is a quick fix for minor issues, resetting should only be done as a last resort when troubleshooting persistent problems.
