An internet speed test measures your connection's performance by evaluating download and upload speeds (Mbps), ping (latency in ms), and jitter.
It helps determine how fast data is sent and received, impacting streaming, gaming, and video calls. 
Speed tests are useful for diagnosing slow connections and verifying ISP performance.
You can use our App for a speed test. Go to the Home menu, select WLAN speed test and run it.
