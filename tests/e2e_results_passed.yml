        ground_truth: "Restarting or rebooting a router involves turning it off and back on without changing any settings, which can help resolve temporary issues like slow speeds or dropped connections. Resetting a router, however, restores it to factory settings, erasing all custom configurations such as the Wi-Fi name, password, and advanced settings. Resetting should only be done as a last resort when troubleshooting persistent problems."
