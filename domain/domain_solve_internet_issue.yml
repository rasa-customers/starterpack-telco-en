      Your network download speed is {network_speed} Mbps. 
      That's definitely not good.

      Let's reboot your router.
      It helps resolving most issues with speed.

        {network_speed} Mbps, Awesome! ðŸš€
        If the Internet gets slow again, you can always reset the router.
        If that doesn't help, let me know, and we can try something else. ðŸ˜Š

        Your network speed is {network_speed} Mbps.
        That's too low

        {network_speed} Mbps sounds right. The speed seems to be in order.

        The result of my test shows that there is no technical issues between your home and our core network.
        However, if you're still experiencing slow browsing or buffering,it could be due to network congestion, too many connected devices, or Wi-Fi interference. 
        Try moving closer to your router or disconnecting unused devices.

        No problem! If you need help later, feel free to ask.
        In the meantime, you might try checking for background apps using bandwidth or reducing the number of connected devices.
        Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you!
