        I see.
        I would need you to run a network speed test ðŸ›œ.
        This will help identify the root cause of the issue you are facing.

        Now, you know what is a network speed test and how to run.

       Can you please run the test now and tell me your current network speed?

      Oh, I see {network_speed} Mbps is definitely not good, it explains the issue you are facing.

        We are making good progress!
        If you run the test again, what is the network speed now?

        {network_speed_again} Mbps, Awesome! ðŸš€
        If the Internet gets slow again, you can always reset the router.
        If that doesn't help, let me know, and we can try something else. ðŸ˜Š

        {network_speed} Mbps is still low, not much has changed...

        {network_speed} Mbps sounds right. The speed seems to be in order.

        When you experience slow Internet can be a factor to resolve the issue
        for instance when browsing websites or using some apps.
