        I see.
        I would need you to run a network speed test ðŸ›œ.
        This will help identify the root cause of the issue you are facing.

       Can you please run the test now and tell me your current network speed?

      Oh, I see {network_speed} Mbps is definitely not good, it explains the issue you are facing.

        We are making good progress!
        If you run the test again, what is the network speed now?

        {network_speed_again} Mbps, Awesome! ðŸš€
        If the Internet gets slow again, you can always reset the router.
        If that doesn't help, let me know, and we can try something else. ðŸ˜Š

        {network_speed} Mbps sounds right. The speed seems to be in order.

        When do you experience slow Internet: browsing websites or using some apps?
