        I see.
        I need you to run a network speed test ðŸ›œ.
        This will help identify the root cause of the issue you are facing.

        {network_speed_again} Mbps, Awesome! ðŸš€
        If the Internet gets slow again, you can always reset the router.
        If that doesn't help, let me know, and we can try something else. ðŸ˜Š

        {network_speed} Mbps sounds right. The speed seems to be in order.

        When you experience slow Internet can be a factor to resolve the issue
        for instance when browsing websites or using some apps.
